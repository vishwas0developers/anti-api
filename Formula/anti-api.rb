      Start Anti-API with:
        anti-api

      This Homebrew package ships prebuilt binaries and disables in-app self-update.
      Use Homebrew to update this install:
        brew upgrade anti-api
    EOS
  end

  test do
    output = shell_output("#{bin}/anti-api --update-only 2>&1")
    assert_match "managed by Homebrew", output
  end
